# Constantcontact

The code presented is a simple Python script that uses the Constant Contact API to create a new contact and add them to a specific contact list. It sends a POST request to create the contact and a PUT request to add the contact to the list. If the requests are successful, it prints a message indicating that the contact has been added to the list. The Constant Contact API can be used for a wide range of marketing and email-related tasks, and this code provides a basic example of how to interact with it using Python.
